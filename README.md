# C++ Containers Flowchart

This repository contains an editable version of [Mikael Persson's flowchart on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/22671607/10699882), inspired by [David Moor's C++ Container Cheatsheet](https://web.archive.org/web/20180824133558/homepages.e3.net.nz/%7Edjm/cppcontainers.html).

## Why This Flowchart?

C++ evolves constantly, bringing updates and new best practices. I prefer Moor's version over Persson's for its clarity and detail, but it’s crucial to design and edit your own flowchart to keep up with these changes. Personalizing your flowchart ensures it reflects current C++ standards and suits your specific needs.

## How to Use

1. **Editable Format**: The flowchart is available as a `.drawio` file. You can download and edit it using [Draw.io](https://draw.io/) (now also known as Diagrams.net).
2. **Quick Edits**: Make updates or modifications as C++ evolves, or tailor it to your project’s requirements.
